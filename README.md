  ## Description
  This is a basic implementation of the classic TicTacToe game, created with Unity and C#. The project includes a main menu, a game scene, and a simple game logic system.

  ## Project Structure
 The project contains the following components:
 
  ### Scenes:
  
  Menu – Start screen where players can begin a game.
  
  Game – The main TicTacToe board and gameplay.

  ### Scripts:
  
  Board.cs – Handles the core game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and board state.
  
  MenuManager.cs – Manages UI elements and navigation between scenes.
